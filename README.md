## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14.x or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- FFmpeg for audio processing
- Modern web browser (for extension)
- Google Cloud Platform account (for Calendar integration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waghib/Speech-To-Plan-reminder.git
   cd Speech-To-Plan-reminder

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure your database, API keys, and other settings

6. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

7. Set up Google Calendar Integration:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Calendar API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application type)
   - Download the client secrets file and save it as `client_secret_[YOUR_CLIENT_ID].apps.googleusercontent.com.json` in the project root

## Running the Application

1. Start both servers using the provided script:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   .\start-servers.ps1
   
   # On Linux/Mac
   # Use the equivalent bash script
   ```

   This will start:
   - Python server on port 8000
   - Node.js server on port 3000

2. Access the application through the browser extension:
   - Load the extension from the `extension` directory in Chrome
   - Click on the extension icon to open the popup interface

3. When adding a task with a due date, the application will:
   - Save the task in the local database
   - Create a corresponding event in your Google Calendar
   - Set up reminders (1 day and 1 hour before the event)
   - First-time users will need to authorize the application to access their Google Calendar

## Calendar Integration Features

- **Automatic Event Creation**: Tasks with due dates are automatically added to your Google Calendar
